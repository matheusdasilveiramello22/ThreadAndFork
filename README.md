# Basic project using Threads and Forks

### MatrixMultiplicationWithFork.c use Forks to multiplicate matrix, its possible set dimensions of it.

#### How to run the code:
- gcc -o MatrixMultiplicationWithFork MatrixMultiplicationWithFork.c
- ./MatrixMultiplicationWithFork
- On code you will set matrix dimensions.

### PortScanWithFork.c use Forks to scan all network 65,535 of your computer.

#### How to run the code:
- gcc -o PSWF PortScanWithFork.c
- ./PSWF
- Its possible to set the numbers of Forks that should be created

### PortScanWithThread.c use Threads to scan all network 65,535 of your computer.
- gcc -o PSWT PortScanWithThread.c
- ./PSWT
